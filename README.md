## üöÄ About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at PUC-GO passionate about technology, innovation, and solving real-world problems through software and AI.

Currently, I'm a CNPq research fellow focusing on financial market prediction using computational and machine learning techniques. I also collaborate on climate change modeling and environmental data analysis projects.

My competitive programming experience has sharpened my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, while my role as a teaching assistant has enhanced my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.

As a scout, I've developed leadership, resilience, teamwork, and adaptability, learning to overcome challenges, collaborate effectively in diverse teams, and embrace continuous personal growth.
