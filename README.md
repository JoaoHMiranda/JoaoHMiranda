## üöÄ About Me

I am a Computer Science student at PUC-GO, interested in software development, data analysis, algorithm design, and artificial intelligence. My academic and research experience includes work in metaheuristics, machine learning, and statistical modeling, often applied to real-world problems.

Currently, I am a CNPq research fellow working on projects related to financial market analysis and prediction, using computational and machine-learning techniques to explore data patterns. I also contribute to climate change modeling initiatives through the Institutional Research Support Program at PUC-GO, applying AI and data science methods to environmental datasets.

I've been involved in competitive programming, which has given me practical experience with algorithms and problem-solving. As a teaching assistant in Algorithms, I've supported peers in understanding technical concepts and developing their programming skills.

Outside of academia, my background as a scout has shaped how I approach teamwork, leadership, and adaptability‚Äîqualities I bring into both technical and collaborative settings.
